Prepare the data for modeling

## adding the new four feature into the dataset
In order to further model preparation, I added the four new feature into the data. I think the new features can have some relationship to help me evaluate the user ratings.Then I selected the column which might be useful for our future model preparation. 
```{r prepare the data}
user_rating_model <- df %>%    
  avg_rating_count_ver() %>%
  price_degree() %>% 
  select(user_rating_ver,size_bytes,price,price_degree,avg_rating_count_ver,rating_count_ver,sup_devices_num,cont_rating,
         ipad_sc_urls_num,lang_num,vpp_lic)

user_rating_model
dim(user_rating_model)
names(user_rating_model)
head(user_rating_model)
```
Now I use 'assert' to check the new feature varaibles I added to ensure that the new feature variables are what I wanted.
```{r test the added feature tests for final user_rating_model}

user_rating_model %>% 
  assert(in_set(c("Low", "Normal", "High")), price_degree)

user_rating_model %>% 
  assert(within_bounds(lower.bound = 0, upper.bound = Inf, allow.na = FALSE),avg_rating_count_ver)

```
I did the test above. By doing the test for user rating model, we can again prove that the featute engineering functions have been added to our dataset. 


Now we can do the further model exploration.
